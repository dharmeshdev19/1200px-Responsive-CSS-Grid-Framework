# 1200px-Responsive-CSS-Grid-Framework

### A Responsive CSS Grid Framework based on 1200px for larger screens


The only reason for me to create this framework is to build my portfolio website, but guess what it can be used for other projects as well which needs to be renderd on larger screens

For more realtime application of this framework have a look at my [portfolio](http://dharmeshdev.com/resume_website) which is build using this grid framework
